Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, and David Yates.[5] Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), while the remaining films' screenplays were written by Steve Kloves. Production took place over ten years, with the main story arc following Harry's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort.[6]
            
            Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length parts.[7] Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.[8][9]
            
            Deathly Hallows – Part 1, Philosopher's Stone, and Deathly Hallows – Part 2 are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, and ranking them as the 48th-, 47th-, and 13th-highest-grossing films, with Philosopher's Stone and Deathly Hallows – Part 2 grossed over $1 billion.
